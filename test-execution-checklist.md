## 7. Current Failing Tests

### Authentication Tests

  - [ ] POST /auth/register should create user and return token on successful registration
    - Expected status 201, received 400

### LLM Service Tests
- [ ] generatePillars()
  - [ ] should generate pillars successfully for a valid niche
  - [ ] should throw an error if LLM response is empty
  - [ ] should throw an error if LLM response does not contain valid pillars
  - [ ] should retry LLM request on failure and eventually throw an error

- [ ] generateContentPoints()
  - [ ] should generate content points for all sections
  - [ ] should handle empty outline
  - [ ] should handle invalid LLM response

- [ ] mergeContentIntoArticle()
  - [ ] should successfully merge content into an article with valid outline
  - [ ] should handle an empty outline gracefully
  - [ ] should handle sections with no content points
  - [ ] should throw an error if sendLLMRequest fails

### Articles API Tests
- [ ] GET /api/articles

    - Expected article titles don't match (Test Article 2 vs Test Article 1)

### TypeScript/Build Errors
- [ ] Protocol Guard TypeScript Errors

## Notes
- Priority: Fix type definitions first as they affect all test suites
- Document any patterns or anti-patterns discovered during testing
- Track security implications found during test execution
- Added improved type safety for user object and headers
- Standardized Redis key prefixes (e.g., blacklist:)
- Using 'unknown' as intermediate step for type casting to ensure type safety
- Improved session cleanup with proper threshold handling
- Enhanced error monitoring and categorization
- Added comprehensive Jest matcher type definitions
- Improved integration test patterns with proper cleanup
- Better organized Jest matchers by category for maintainability
- Enhanced test container with immutable state and subscriptions
