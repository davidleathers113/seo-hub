# Task Overview & Current Status

## Core Problem
- Workflow settings and niches endpoints were failing due to a mismatch between MongoDB and PostgreSQL user IDs
- The database was using integer IDs while the auth system was using UUIDs

## Implementation Status
- Successfully migrated user_step_settings table to use UUID for user_id
- Updated workflow routes to use JWT auth middleware
- Implemented PostgreSQL niche client for proper database access
- Both endpoints now working correctly with UUID user IDs

## Key Architectural Decisions
1. Switched from MongoDB-specific auth to JWT-based auth for consistency
2. Created dedicated PostgreSQL clients for better separation of concerns
3. Implemented proper data transformation between client and server
4. Used UUID for user IDs across all tables for consistency

## Technical Context

### Database Schema Changes
- Modified user_step_settings table to use UUID for user_id
- Niches table already using UUID for user_id and id columns
- Maintained PostgreSQL's native UUID type support

### Key Files Modified
1. server/routes/workflow.ts
   - Updated to use JWT auth middleware
   - Added data transformation for client/server formats

2. server/database/postgres/clients/niche-client.ts
   - New PostgreSQL client for niche operations
   - Handles proper data types and transformations

3. server/database/index.ts
   - Updated to use PostgreSQL niche client
   - Maintains mock implementations for unimplemented features

4. server/routes/niches.ts
   - Updated to use JWT auth middleware
   - Simplified auth type handling

### Current Status
- Workflow settings endpoint working (/api/workflow/settings)
  - Successfully fetches LLMs and workflow steps
  - Returns empty settings for new users (expected)
- Niches endpoint working (/api/niches)
  - Successfully authenticates with JWT
  - Returns empty list for new users (expected)

### Next Steps
1. Implement remaining PostgreSQL clients for other features
2. Update other routes to use JWT auth consistently
3. Add proper error handling for database operations
4. Implement data validation and sanitization

### Known Issues
- Other database operations still using mock implementations
- Need to implement proper session management
- Error handling could be improved
- Need to add proper logging for debugging

### Developer Notes
- Always use UUID for user IDs in new tables
- Use camelCase in client code, snake_case in database
- Implement proper data transformations in the clients
- Follow the pattern in niche-client.ts for new clients
