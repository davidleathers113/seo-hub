# Nextacular Integration Status

## Task Overview
- **Core Problem**: Integrating Nextacular's workspace features into existing Supabase-based content creation app
- **Current Status**: Migration files created, awaiting successful execution
- **Key Decisions**: 
  - Keeping existing Supabase direct client setup instead of switching to Next.js's built-in integration
  - Adding workspace support to existing tables rather than recreating schema
  - Using RLS policies for multi-tenant data isolation

## Codebase Navigation

### Key Files (By Priority)
1. `supabase/migrations/20240320000000_add_workspace_features.sql`
   - Adds workspace tables and columns
   - Implements RLS policies
   - Modifies existing tables to support workspaces

2. `types/supabase.ts`
   - Updated with workspace-related types
   - Added workspace_id to existing table types
   - Maintains compatibility with existing code

3. `lib/supabase.ts`
   - Main Supabase client configuration
   - Contains helper functions for data access
   - Needs workspace-related helpers added

4. `src/utils/supabase/server.ts` & `client.ts`
   - New Next.js 13+ Supabase utilities
   - Currently not in use (keeping existing setup)

5. `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
   - Main dashboard implementation
   - Uses existing Supabase client
   - Will need workspace context added

## Technical Context

### External Services
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
  - URL: https://hylrjzwgqwzlrlunhuom.supabase.co
  - Using service role key for migrations
  - RLS enabled for multi-tenant security

### Security Considerations
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented for:
  - Workspace access control
  - Member management
  - Resource isolation
- Service role access limited to migrations

### Failed Approaches
1. Prisma with Supabase
   - Connection issues with pooler
   - RLS compatibility problems
2. Next.js built-in Supabase integration
   - Would require significant refactoring
   - Current setup working well

## Development Progress

### Completed
1. Created workspace database schema
2. Updated TypeScript types
3. Added RLS policies
4. Created migration scripts
5. Verified existing Supabase connection

### Next Steps
1. Execute workspace migration
   - Using new `scripts/apply-workspace-migration.ts`
   - Handles SQL statement splitting
   - Includes error handling

2. Add workspace context
   - Create workspace context provider
   - Update existing components
   - Add workspace selection UI

3. Update API routes
   - Add workspace filtering
   - Implement member management
   - Add domain handling

### Known Issues
1. Migration script execution failing
   - RPC function not available
   - Working on direct SQL execution
2. Existing data needs workspace assignment
   - Migration should handle null workspace_ids
   - Need to consider data migration strategy

## Developer Notes

### Architecture Insights
- App uses hybrid approach:
  - Server-side: Next.js App Router
  - Client-side: Direct Supabase client
  - Real-time: Supabase subscriptions

### Critical Areas
1. Data Migration
   - Existing content needs workspace assignment
   - Consider default workspace creation

2. Authentication Flow
   - Needs workspace context after login
   - Consider workspace invitation flow

3. Real-time Updates
   - Existing subscriptions need workspace filtering
   - Consider performance with multiple workspaces

### Environment Setup
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://hylrjzwgqwzlrlunhuom.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your-anon-key]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[your-service-key]
```

### Migration Commands
```bash
# Test connection
ts-node scripts/test-supabase.ts

# Apply workspace migration
ts-node scripts/apply-workspace-migration.ts
